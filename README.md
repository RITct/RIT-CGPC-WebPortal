INTRODUCTON

The aim of our project is ‘Automation’ and ‘Digitizing’ of Training and Placement related procedures with maximum optimization, abstraction and security. A Web App or Web Portal for the Career Guidance and Placement Cell (CGPC) of a college is of vital need for the students and the institute management for the purpose of proper placement and training of the aspiring students of the institute. It helps the students to provide their profiles to the CGPC of the institute, update their respective profiles (with their gradual approach towards course end), get to know about the companies coming for the On campus/Off campus/Pool/Group Pool categories of campus interviews and apply for these companies through the system. All the students of the final year batches of various streams can register their profiles. The CGPC then remains in continuous touch with all the students of the institute. This dedicated web portal for the institute’s CGPC can be uploaded to server and can be accessed by the students, staff as well as by the company representatives from anywhere. The system remains connected with the profile databases of the various students to continuously monitor the variety of scopes available for the students' placement.
